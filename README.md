# play-samlsso

SAML 2.0 SSO for Play Framework with OAuth2 grant support. Only supports Play Java and tested with WSO2 Identity Server.

This project was inspired by [play-pac4j](https://github.com/leleuj/play-pac4j) library. Also some parts are directly 
based on SAML implementation of [pac4j](https://github.com/leleuj/pac4j). Main reason behind creating this library is to
  understand SAML SSO internals and have more control over how SSO is done. Also I am planning to implement [AML 2.0 
    Profile for OAuth2 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-21) on top of this.

## Design and Usage

### Authentication Flow

1. User tries to access specific URL of Play App.
2. If the above URL is secured using ```@RequiresAuthentication``` annotation, ```RequiresAuthenticationAction``` will get invoked.
3. This action will check for whether there is a existing session and whether required user profile information is there
 in the session.
 
 3.1 If there is a valida session, action will hand over the request to actual web action.
 
 3.2 If no valid session is found, action will start the SSO process from step 4.
 
4. ```RequiresAuthenticationAction``` will get the URL for the current request and pass that to ```SAMLSSOManager``` for 
building authentication request.
5. Using the service providers key information, configuration and identity provider meta data, ```SAMLSSOManager``` will 
  build authentication request (Redirect response) and send it back to user's browser as the response.
6. This redirect response will take user to identity provider and identity provider may ask for authenticating into it. 
After successful authentication, user will get redirected to service providers callback URL with *RelayState* parameter.
7. Once the SSO authentication response is received at the service provider, SP will validate the response, setup the session and redirect 
user to correct URL based on RelayState.

Your Play controllers must extend ```SAMLSSOJavaController``` class for Play Java application.

```
public class MyApplication extends SAMLSSOJavaController {
    ...
}
```

Specific actions of your Play Java application can be protected by using ```RequiresAuthentication``` annotation.

```
@RequiresAuthentication
public static Result protectedResource(){
    // User profile is avaibale only if this session is authenticated with Identity Provider
    UserProfile userProfile = getUserProfile()
}
```

```SAMLSSOJavaController``` defines methods needed to handle SAML SSO related callbacks.
 
 * ```authenticatedCB``` - Identity provider should redirect back to this action after the authentication is done as a request from service provider. 
 * ```singleLogoutCB``` - Identity provider will send a request to this URL to complete single logout request from a other service provider.
 * ```singleLogout``` - If you need single logout support in your application, you can call this action.
